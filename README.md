# doolist

A simple to-do list application where users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks. It should have a clean and user-friendly interface, with a clear way to mark tasks as completed or pending. The main interface should display tasks organized by their completion status, and allow users to easily interact with their tasks. The app should support basic task information such as title and due date. The overall design should be minimalistic, with a focus on functionality and ease of use.
